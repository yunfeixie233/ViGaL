          <p>We propose to post-train MLLMs via RL to play visual games. We demonstrate this with two games: the classic arcade game Snake, and Rotation, a self-designed task to investigate spatial reasoning.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Observation</strong>: In each game, the model receives multimodal inputs, including images to provide visual cues and text to describe tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Reflection</strong>: It then reflects to choose an action, following carefully designed reasoning instructions.</li>
            <li><strong>Action</strong>: After reflection, the model outputs chain-of-thoughts and its action decision, e.g., best/worst move or predicted angle. The action will receive a reward based on its performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Generalization</strong>: Through game playing, the model obtains reasoning abilities that transfer to downstream multimodal tasks.</li>
          </ul>

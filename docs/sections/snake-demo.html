            We get the inspiration from <a href="">Snake AI Arena</a>, where LLMs battle Snake game.
            However, our setting includes both both images of board and text as inputs to elicit spation reasoning capabilites,
            while <a href="">Snake Bench</a> only provides textual board information.

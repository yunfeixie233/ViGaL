            We hypothesize that gameplay fosters fundamental skills like spatial modeling and sequential planning that can transfer to visual math questions.
            Different games may enhance distinct reasoning abilities.
            To investigate this hypothesis, we analyze accuracy differences across <a href="https://mathverse-cuhk.github.io/">MathVerse</a> subcategories between ViGaL models trained with Snake or Rotation, as shown in the figure below.

          <ul>
            <li>Training on the Snake improves performance on the <strong>Expressions</strong> and <strong>Coordinates</strong> subcategories. Both tasks involve coordinate-level interpretations of graphical representations, aligning with the spatial reasoning in Snake’s 2D-grid environment.</li>
            <li>Training on Rotation notably enhances performance on questions about <strong>Angles</strong> and <strong>Lengths</strong>, consistent with Rotation’s requirement to reason about rotational angles of objects.</li>
            <li>These results suggest that different games obtains specialized reasoning skills that correspond to their unique gameplay mechanics.</li>

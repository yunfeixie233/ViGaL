Checking safety: (2,1) is within the board boundaries (0\u20139 for both x and y), it does not collide with our own snake\u2019s body (which is empty), and it does not coincide with any enemy snake\u2019s position [(1,0), (0,0), (0,1)]. In addition, predicting the enemy snake\u2019s move (with their head at (1,0)), they might move UP to (1,1) or RIGHT to (2,0), neither of which conflicts with our DOWN move. The other moves (UP to (2,3), LEFT to (1,2), RIGHT to (3,2)) are safe but do not move us closer to the nearest apple as efficiently as DOWN does. Therefore, the best move is DOWN. Since none of the moves result in the snake moving outside the board, into an enemy snake, or into itself, there are no worst moves.\n</think>\n<best_answer>DOWN</best_answer>\n<worst_answer>None</worst_answer>",

Our available moves are:\n\u2003\u2022 UP to (3,2)\n\u2003\u2022 DOWN to (3,0)\n\u2003\u2022 LEFT to (2,1)\n\u2003\u2022 RIGHT to (4,1)\n\nStep 1 \u2013 Avoid Worst Moves:\n\u2022 LEFT moves to (2,1), which is our own body. That is a deadly move.\n\u2022 All other moves remain within the board (0\u20139 for both x and y) and do not collide with enemy snakes whose positions are [(1,2), (1,1), (1,0)].\nThus, the worst move is LEFT.\n\nStep 2 \u2013 Choose Best Move Toward an Apple:\nWe have apples at [(7,1), (9,0), (5,3), (9,7), (0,8)]. Calculating Manhattan distances from our current position (3,1):\n\u2003\u2013 To (7,1): |3\u20137| + |1\u20131| = 4\n\u2003\u2013 To (5,3): |3\u20135| + |1\u20133| = 2 + 2 = 4\nThe nearest apples are (7,1) and (5,3).\n\nNow, evaluating our safe moves:\n\u2022 UP to (3,2):\n\u2003\u2013 Distance to (5,3): |3\u20135| + |2\u20133| = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\u2022 RIGHT to (4,1):\n\u2003\u2013 Distance to (7,1): |4\u20137| + |1\u20131| = 3 + 0 = 3.\n\u2022 DOWN to (3,0):\n\u2003\u2013 Distance to (7,1): |3\u20137| + |0\u20131| = 4 + 1 = 5.\nBoth UP and RIGHT take us 3 steps away from a nearest apple. Considering we also want to avoid any potential conflict with enemy snakes (with head at (1,2) likely moving to nearby safe squares), both moves appear safe. However, RIGHT aligns directly toward apple (7,1) horizontally and appears efficient, and is not predicted to conflict with the enemy\u2019s path.\nThus, the best move is RIGHT.\n</think>\n<best_answer>RIGHT</best_answer>\n<worst_answer>LEFT</worst_answer>",

Our available moves are:\n\u2003\u2022 UP to (3,2)\n\u2003\u2022 DOWN to (3,0)\n\u2003\u2022 LEFT to (2,1)\n\u2003\u2022 RIGHT to (4,1)\n\nStep 1 \u2013 Avoid Worst Moves:\n\u2022 LEFT moves to (2,1), which is our own body. That is a deadly move.\n\u2022 All other moves remain within the board (0\u20139 for both x and y) and do not collide with enemy snakes whose positions are [(1,2), (1,1), (1,0)].\nThus, the worst move is LEFT.\n\nStep 2 \u2013 Choose Best Move Toward an Apple:\nWe have apples at [(7,1), (9,0), (5,3), (9,7), (0,8)]. Calculating Manhattan distances from our current position (3,1):\n\u2003\u2013 To (7,1): |3\u20137| + |1\u20131| = 4\n\u2003\u2013 To (5,3): |3\u20135| + |1\u20133| = 2 + 2 = 4\nThe nearest apples are (7,1) and (5,3).\n\nNow, evaluating our safe moves:\n\u2022 UP to (3,2):\n\u2003\u2013 Distance to (5,3): |3\u20135| + |2\u20133| = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\u2022 RIGHT to (4,1):\n\u2003\u2013 Distance to (7,1): |4\u20137| + |1\u20131| = 3 + 0 = 3.\n\u2022 DOWN to (3,0):\n\u2003\u2013 Distance to (7,1): |3\u20137| + |0\u20131| = 4 + 1 = 5.\nBoth UP and RIGHT take us 3 steps away from a nearest apple. Considering we also want to avoid any potential conflict with enemy snakes (with head at (1,2) likely moving to nearby safe squares), both moves appear safe. However, RIGHT aligns directly toward apple (7,1) horizontally and appears efficient, and is not predicted to conflict with the enemy\u2019s path.\nThus, the best move is RIGHT.\n</think>\n<best_answer>RIGHT</best_answer>\n<worst_answer>LEFT</worst_answer>",

Checking the possible moves from (8,2):\n\u2022 UP would move the head to (8,3) \u2013 this is already part of our body.\n\u2022 LEFT would move the head to (7,2) \u2013 also part of our body.\n\u2022 DOWN goes to (8,1), which is within the grid and free.\n\u2022 RIGHT goes to (9,2), which is within bounds and free.\nLooking at the apples at [(9, 0), (9, 7), (0, 8), (1, 8), (9, 1)], the nearest apple from our head is at (9,1) with a Manhattan distance of 2 (|8-9|+|2-1|). From (8,2), both a RIGHT move to (9,2) and a DOWN move to (8,1) reduce the distance to the apple to 1. \nNow, considering the enemy snake with positions [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)], we predict its head is at (6,1) (assuming the first coordinate represents the head). Its nearest apple appears to be (9,1) (Manhattan distance from (6,1) is 3), so it will likely move RIGHT from (6,1) to (7,1). Both our candidate moves DOWN and RIGHT remain away from the enemy (our RIGHT move at (9,2) is safely out of their predicted path, and our DOWN move at (8,1) is also safe).\nBetween these two, both moves bring us equally closer to the target apple. However, choosing RIGHT moves our head directly into the column of the apple (column 9) which may set us up better for the subsequent approach. Thus, RIGHT is chosen as the best move.\nThe moves UP and LEFT are clearly worst since they would have our head collide with our body.\n</think>\n<best_answer>RIGHT</best_answer>\n<worst_answer>UP, LEFT</worst_answer>",

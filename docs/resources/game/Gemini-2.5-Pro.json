Assuming no body segments.\n    *   Apples are at: [(6, 8), (9, 7), (6, 2), (5, 6), (3, 9)].\n    *   Board is 10x10 (0,0 to 9,9).\n    *   Last move was LEFT (not relevant for next move calculation, but noted).\n\n2.  **Determine Possible Moves:** From (4, 7), the possible moves are:\n    *   UP: (4, 8)\n    *   DOWN: (4, 6)\n    *   LEFT: (3, 7)\n    *   RIGHT: (5, 7)\n\n3.  **Identify Worst Moves (Check Rule 2):**\n    *   **Out of Bounds:**\n        *   UP (4, 8): Within bounds (0<=4<=9, 0<=8<=9). OK.\n        *   DOWN (4, 6): Within bounds (0<=4<=9, 0<=6<=9). OK.\n        *   LEFT (3, 7): Within bounds (0<=3<=9, 0<=7<=9). OK.\n        *   RIGHT (5, 7): Within bounds (0<=5<=9, 0<=7<=9). OK.\n        *   No boundary violations.\n    *   **Own Body Collision:** My snake has no body segments [], so no self-collision is possible. OK.\n    *   **Enemy Snake Collision:** The enemy snake's head is at (1, 6). Assuming the rule \"into a space occupied by another snake's body\" includes the head position:\n        *   UP (4, 8): Not (1, 6). OK.\n        *   DOWN (4, 6): Not (1, 6).

OK.\n        *   No collision with the current enemy position.\n    *   **Predict Enemy Move (Optional but good practice):** Enemy at (1, 6) could move to (1, 7), (1, 5), (0, 6), (2, 6). None of these conflict with my potential next moves (4, 8), (4, 6), (3, 7), (5, 7).\n    *   **Conclusion on Worst Moves:** None of the possible moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are worst moves.\n\n4.  **Identify Best Move (Check Rule 3):**\n    *   **Calculate Distances to Apples:** From head (4, 7):\n        *   Apple (6, 8): |4 - 6| + |7 - 8| = 2 + 1 = 3\n        *   Apple (9, 7): |4 - 9| + |7 - 7| = 5 + 0 = 5\n        *   Apple (6, 2): |4 - 6| + |7 - 2| = 2 + 5 = 7\n        *   Apple (5, 6): |4 - 5| + |7 - 6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n        *   Apple (3, 9): |4 - 3| + |7 - 9| = 1 + 2 = 3\n    *   **Find Nearest Apple:** The nearest apple is (5, 6) with a Manhattan distance of 2.\n    *   **Evaluate Moves Towards Nearest Apple (5, 6):**\n        *   UP to (4, 8): New distance to (5, 6) = |4 - 5| + |8 - 6| = 1 + 2 = 3. (Increases distance).\n        *   DOWN to (4, 6): New distance to (5, 6) = |4 - 5| + |6 - 6| = 1 + 0 = 1. (Decreases distance).\n        *   LEFT to (3, 7): New distance to (5, 6) = |3 - 5| + |7 - 6| = 2 + 1 = 3. (Increases distance).\n        *   RIGHT to (5, 7): New distance to (5, 6) = |5 - 5| + |7 - 6| = 0 + 1 = 1. (Decreases distance).\n    *   **Select Best Move:** Both DOWN and RIGHT reduce the distance to the nearest apple (5, 6) maximally (from 2 to 1). Both are safe moves. Following Rule 3, either DOWN or RIGHT is a valid best move. Let's choose one, for example, RIGHT, as it moves towards coordinate 5 which is the x-coordinate of the target apple. It also gets closer to the apple at (6, 8).\n\n5.  **Final Answer Formulation:**\n    *   Best move: RIGHT (or DOWN). Choose RIGHT.\n    *   Worst moves: None.\n</think>\n<best_answer>RIGHT</best_answer>\n<worst_answer>None</worst_answer>",

Assuming no body segments.\n    *   Apples are at: [(6, 8), (9, 7), (6, 2), (5, 6), (3, 9)].\n    *   Board is 10x10 (0,0 to 9,9).\n    *   Last move was LEFT (not relevant for next move calculation, but noted).\n\n2.  **Determine Possible Moves:** From (4, 7), the possible moves are:\n    *   UP: (4, 8)\n    *   DOWN: (4, 6)\n    *   LEFT: (3, 7)\n    *   RIGHT: (5, 7)\n\n3.  **Identify Worst Moves (Check Rule 2):**\n    *   **Out of Bounds:**\n        *   UP (4, 8): Within bounds (0<=4<=9, 0<=8<=9). OK.\n        *   DOWN (4, 6): Within bounds (0<=4<=9, 0<=6<=9). OK.\n        *   LEFT (3, 7): Within bounds (0<=3<=9, 0<=7<=9). OK.\n        *   RIGHT (5, 7): Within bounds (0<=5<=9, 0<=7<=9). OK.\n        *   No boundary violations.\n    *   **Own Body Collision:** My snake has no body segments [], so no self-collision is possible. OK.\n    *   **Enemy Snake Collision:** The enemy snake's head is at (1, 6). Assuming the rule \"into a space occupied by another snake's body\" includes the head position:\n        *   UP (4, 8): Not (1, 6). OK.\n        *   DOWN (4, 6): Not (1, 6). OK.\n        *   LEFT (3, 7): Not (1, 6). OK.\n        *   RIGHT (5, 7): Not (1, 6). OK.\n        *   No collision with the current enemy position.\n    *   **Predict Enemy Move (Optional but good practice):** Enemy at (1, 6) could move to (1, 7), (1, 5), (0, 6), (2, 6). None of these conflict with my potential next moves (4, 8), (4, 6), (3, 7), (5, 7).\n    *   **Conclusion on Worst Moves:** None of the possible moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are worst moves.\n\n4.  **Identify Best Move (Check Rule 3):**\n    *   **Calculate Distances to Apples:** From head (4, 7):\n        *   Apple (6, 8): |4 - 6| + |7 - 8| = 2 + 1 = 3\n        *   Apple (9, 7): |4 - 9| + |7 - 7| = 5 + 0 = 5\n        *   Apple (6, 2): |4 - 6| + |7 - 2| = 2 + 5 = 7\n        *   Apple (5, 6): |4 - 5| + |7 - 6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n        *   Apple (3, 9): |4 - 3| + |7 - 9| = 1 + 2 = 3\n    *   **Find Nearest Apple:** The nearest apple is (5, 6) with a Manhattan distance of 2.\n    *   **Evaluate Moves Towards Nearest Apple (5, 6):**\n        *   UP to (4, 8): New distance to (5, 6) = |4 - 5| + |8 - 6| = 1 + 2 = 3. (Increases distance).\n        *   DOWN to (4, 6): New distance to (5, 6) = |4 - 5| + |6 - 6| = 1 + 0 = 1. (Decreases distance).\n        *   LEFT to (3, 7): New distance to (5, 6) = |3 - 5| + |7 - 6| = 2 + 1 = 3. (Increases distance).\n        *   RIGHT to (5, 7): New distance to (5, 6) = |5 - 5| + |7 - 6| = 0 + 1 = 1. (Decreases distance).\n    *   **Select Best Move:** Both DOWN and RIGHT reduce the distance to the nearest apple (5, 6) maximally (from 2 to 1). Both are safe moves. Following Rule 3, either DOWN or RIGHT is a valid best move. Let's choose one, for example, RIGHT, as it moves towards coordinate 5 which is the x-coordinate of the target apple. It also gets closer to the apple at (6, 8).\n\n5.  **Final Answer Formulation:**\n    *   Best move: RIGHT (or DOWN). Choose RIGHT.\n    *   Worst moves: None.\n</think>\n<best_answer>RIGHT</best_answer>\n<worst_answer>None</worst_answer>",

Assuming no body segments.\n    *   Apples are at: [(6, 8), (9, 7), (6, 2), (5, 6), (3, 9)].\n    *   Board is 10x10 (0,0 to 9,9).\n    *   Last move was LEFT (not relevant for next move calculation, but noted).\n\n2.  **Determine Possible Moves:** From (4, 7), the possible moves are:\n    *   UP: (4, 8)\n    *   DOWN: (4, 6)\n    *   LEFT: (3, 7)\n    *   RIGHT: (5, 7)\n\n3.  **Identify Worst Moves (Check Rule 2):**\n    *   **Out of Bounds:**\n        *   UP (4, 8): Within bounds (0<=4<=9, 0<=8<=9). OK.\n        *   DOWN (4, 6): Within bounds (0<=4<=9, 0<=6<=9). OK.\n        *   LEFT (3, 7): Within bounds (0<=3<=9, 0<=7<=9). OK.\n        *   RIGHT (5, 7): Within bounds (0<=5<=9, 0<=7<=9). OK.\n        *   No boundary violations.\n    *   **Own Body Collision:** My snake has no body segments [], so no self-collision is possible. OK.\n    *   **Enemy Snake Collision:** The enemy snake's head is at (1, 6). Assuming the rule \"into a space occupied by another snake's body\" includes the head position:\n        *   UP (4, 8): Not (1, 6). OK.\n        *   DOWN (4, 6): Not (1, 6). OK.\n        *   LEFT (3, 7): Not (1, 6). OK.\n        *   RIGHT (5, 7): Not (1, 6). OK.\n        *   No collision with the current enemy position.\n    *   **Predict Enemy Move (Optional but good practice):** Enemy at (1, 6) could move to (1, 7), (1, 5), (0, 6), (2, 6). None of these conflict with my potential next moves (4, 8), (4, 6), (3, 7), (5, 7).\n    *   **Conclusion on Worst Moves:** None of the possible moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are worst moves.\n\n4.  **Identify Best Move (Check Rule 3):**\n    *   **Calculate Distances to Apples:** From head (4, 7):\n        *   Apple (6, 8): |4 - 6| + |7 - 8| = 2 + 1 = 3\n        *   Apple (9, 7): |4 - 9| + |7 - 7| = 5 + 0 = 5\n        *   Apple (6, 2): |4 - 6| + |7 - 2| = 2 + 5 = 7\n        *   Apple (5, 6): |4 - 5| + |7 - 6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n        *   Apple (3, 9): |4 - 3| + |7 - 9| = 1 + 2 = 3\n    *   **Find Nearest Apple:** The nearest apple is (5, 6) with a Manhattan distance of 2.\n    *   **Evaluate Moves Towards Nearest Apple (5, 6):**\n        *   UP to (4, 8): New distance to (5, 6) = |4 - 5| + |8 - 6| = 1 + 2 = 3. (Increases distance).\n        *   DOWN to (4, 6): New distance to (5, 6) = |4 - 5| + |6 - 6| = 1 + 0 = 1. (Decreases distance).\n        *   LEFT to (3, 7): New distance to (5, 6) = |3 - 5| + |7 - 6| = 2 + 1 = 3. (Increases distance).\n        *   RIGHT to (5, 7): New distance to (5, 6) = |5 - 5| + |7 - 6| = 0 + 1 = 1. (Decreases distance).\n    *   **Select Best Move:** Both DOWN and RIGHT reduce the distance to the nearest apple (5, 6) maximally (from 2 to 1). Both are safe moves. Following Rule 3, either DOWN or RIGHT is a valid best move. Let's choose one, for example, RIGHT, as it moves towards coordinate 5 which is the x-coordinate of the target apple. It also gets closer to the apple at (6, 8).\n\n5.  **Final Answer Formulation:**\n    *   Best move: RIGHT (or DOWN). Choose RIGHT.\n    *   Worst moves: None.\n</think>\n<best_answer>RIGHT</best_answer>\n<worst_answer>None</worst_answer>",

Therefore, my move LEFT to (4, 6) is likely safe from a head-on collision.\n    *   The only identified worst move is UP due to self-collision.\n\n4.  **Identify best move among safe moves {DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT}:**\n    *   The goal is to get closer to the nearest apple.\n    *   Calculate Manhattan distances from the head (5, 6) to each apple:\n        *   Apple (6, 8): |5 - 6| + |6 - 8| = 1 + 2 = 3\n        *   Apple (9, 7): |5 - 9| + |6 - 7| = 4 + 1 = 5\n        *   Apple (6, 2): |5 - 6| + |6 - 2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n        *   Apple (3, 9): |5 - 3| + |6 - 9| = 2 + 3 = 5\n        *   Apple (5, 9): |5 - 5| + |6 - 9| = 0 + 3 = 3\n    *   The nearest apples are (6, 8) and (5, 9), both at distance 3.\n    *   Evaluate safe moves by calculating the distance to the nearest apples from the resulting positions:\n        *   Move DOWN to (5, 5):\n            *   Dist to (6, 8): |5 - 6| + |5 - 8| = 1 + 3 = 4 (further)\n            *   Dist to (5, 9): |5 - 5| + |5 - 9| = 0 + 4 = 4 (further)\n        *   Move LEFT to (4, 6):\n            *   Dist to (6, 8): |4 - 6| + |6 - 8| = 2 + 2 = 4 (further)\n            *   Dist to (5, 9): |4 - 5| + |6 - 9| = 1 + 3 = 4 (further)\n        *   Move RIGHT to (6, 6):\n            *   Dist to (6, 8): |6 - 6| + |6 - 8| = 0 + 2 = 2 (closer)\n            *   Dist to (5, 9): |6 - 5| + |6 - 9| = 1 + 3 = 4 (further)\n    *   Moving RIGHT is the only safe move that decreases the distance to one of the nearest apples ((6, 8)).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The best move is RIGHT because it is safe and moves closer to the nearest apple at (6, 8). The worst move is UP because it causes a collision with the snake's own body.\n</think><best_answer>RIGHT</best_answer><worst_answer>UP</worst_answer>",

Assuming no body segments.\n    *   Apples are at: [(6, 8), (9, 7), (6, 2), (5, 6), (3, 9)].\n    *   Board is 10x10 (0,0 to 9,9).\n    *   Last move was LEFT (not relevant for next move calculation, but noted).\n\n2.  **Determine Possible Moves:** From (4, 7), the possible moves are:\n    *   UP: (4, 8)\n    *   DOWN: (4, 6)\n    *   LEFT: (3, 7)\n    *   RIGHT: (5, 7)\n\n3.  **Identify Worst Moves (Check Rule 2):**\n    *   **Out of Bounds:**\n        *   UP (4, 8): Within bounds (0<=4<=9, 0<=8<=9). OK.\n        *   DOWN (4, 6): Within bounds (0<=4<=9, 0<=6<=9). OK.\n        *   LEFT (3, 7): Within bounds (0<=3<=9, 0<=7<=9). OK.\n        *   RIGHT (5, 7): Within bounds (0<=5<=9, 0<=7<=9). OK.\n        *   No boundary violations.\n    *   **Own Body Collision:** My snake has no body segments [], so no self-collision is possible. OK.\n    *   **Enemy Snake Collision:** The enemy snake's head is at (1, 6). Assuming the rule \"into a space occupied by another snake's body\" includes the head position:\n        *   UP (4, 8): Not (1, 6). OK.\n        *   DOWN (4, 6): Not (1, 6). OK.\n        *   LEFT (3, 7): Not (1, 6). OK.\n        *   RIGHT (5, 7): Not (1, 6). OK.\n        *   No collision with the current enemy position.\n    *   **Predict Enemy Move (Optional but good practice):** Enemy at (1, 6) could move to (1, 7), (1, 5), (0, 6), (2, 6). None of these conflict with my potential next moves (4, 8), (4, 6), (3, 7), (5, 7).\n    *   **Conclusion on Worst Moves:** None of the possible moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are worst moves.\n\n4.  **Identify Best Move (Check Rule 3):**\n    *   **Calculate Distances to Apples:** From head (4, 7):\n        *   Apple (6, 8): |4 - 6| + |7 - 8| = 2 + 1 = 3\n        *   Apple (9, 7): |4 - 9| + |7 - 7| = 5 + 0 = 5\n        *   Apple (6, 2): |4 - 6| + |7 - 2| = 2 + 5 = 7\n        *   Apple (5, 6): |4 - 5| + |7 - 6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n        *   Apple (3, 9): |4 - 3| + |7 - 9| = 1 + 2 = 3\n    *   **Find Nearest Apple:** The nearest apple is (5, 6) with a Manhattan distance of 2.\n    *   **Evaluate Moves Towards Nearest Apple (5, 6):**\n        *   UP to (4, 8): New distance to (5, 6) = |4 - 5| + |8 - 6| = 1 + 2 = 3. (Increases distance).\n        *   DOWN to (4, 6): New distance to (5, 6) = |4 - 5| + |6 - 6| = 1 + 0 = 1. (Decreases distance).\n        *   LEFT to (3, 7): New distance to (5, 6) = |3 - 5| + |7 - 6| = 2 + 1 = 3. (Increases distance).\n        *   RIGHT to (5, 7): New distance to (5, 6) = |5 - 5| + |7 - 6| = 0 + 1 = 1. (Decreases distance).\n    *   **Select Best Move:** Both DOWN and RIGHT reduce the distance to the nearest apple (5, 6) maximally (from 2 to 1). Both are safe moves. Following Rule 3, either DOWN or RIGHT is a valid best move. Let's choose one, for example, RIGHT, as it moves towards coordinate 5 which is the x-coordinate of the target apple. It also gets closer to the apple at (6, 8).\n\n5.  **Final Answer Formulation:**\n    *   Best move: RIGHT (or DOWN). Choose RIGHT.\n    *   Worst moves: None.\n</think>\n<best_answer>RIGHT</best_answer>\n<worst_answer>None</worst_answer>",

Therefore, my move LEFT to (4, 6) is likely safe from a head-on collision.\n    *   The only identified worst move is UP due to self-collision.\n\n4.  **Identify best move among safe moves {DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT}:**\n    *   The goal is to get closer to the nearest apple.\n    *   Calculate Manhattan distances from the head (5, 6) to each apple:\n        *   Apple (6, 8): |5 - 6| + |6 - 8| = 1 + 2 = 3\n        *   Apple (9, 7): |5 - 9| + |6 - 7| = 4 + 1 = 5\n        *   Apple (6, 2): |5 - 6| + |6 - 2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n        *   Apple (3, 9): |5 - 3| + |6 - 9| = 2 + 3 = 5\n        *   Apple (5, 9): |5 - 5| + |6 - 9| = 0 + 3 = 3\n    *   The nearest apples are (6, 8) and (5, 9), both at distance 3.\n    *   Evaluate safe moves by calculating the distance to the nearest apples from the resulting positions:\n        *   Move DOWN to (5, 5):\n            *   Dist to (6, 8): |5 - 6| + |5 - 8| = 1 + 3 = 4 (further)\n            *   Dist to (5, 9): |5 - 5| + |5 - 9| = 0 + 4 = 4 (further)\n        *   Move LEFT to (4, 6):\n            *   Dist to (6, 8): |4 - 6| + |6 - 8| = 2 + 2 = 4 (further)\n            *   Dist to (5, 9): |4 - 5| + |6 - 9| = 1 + 3 = 4 (further)\n        *   Move RIGHT to (6, 6):\n            *   Dist to (6, 8): |6 - 6| + |6 - 8| = 0 + 2 = 2 (closer)\n            *   Dist to (5, 9): |6 - 5| + |6 - 9| = 1 + 3 = 4 (further)\n    *   Moving RIGHT is the only safe move that decreases the distance to one of the nearest apples ((6, 8)).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The best move is RIGHT because it is safe and moves closer to the nearest apple at (6, 8). The worst move is UP because it causes a collision with the snake's own body.\n</think><best_answer>RIGHT</best_answer><worst_answer>UP</worst_answer>",

There is no immediate head-on collision risk with the *current* safe moves.\n\n4.  **Identify Best Move (Towards Nearest Apple):**\n    *   Safe moves are DOWN and RIGHT.\n    *   Calculate Manhattan distances from the current head position H=(7, 9) to each apple:\n        *   A1=(9, 7): |7 - 9| + |9 - 7| = 2 + 2 = 4\n        *   A2=(6, 2): |7 - 6| + |9 - 2| = 1 + 7 = 8\n        *   A3=(7, 5): |7 - 7| + |9 - 5| = 0 + 4 = 4\n        *   A4=(0, 5): |7 - 0| + |9 - 5| = 7 + 4 = 11\n        *   A5=(3, 3): |7 - 3| + |9 - 3| = 4 + 6 = 10\n    *   The nearest apples are A1=(9, 7) and A3=(7, 5), both at distance 4.\n    *   Evaluate safe moves based on proximity to these nearest apples:\n        *   Move DOWN to P_down=(7, 8):\n            *   Dist(P_down, A1) = |7 - 9| + |8 - 7| = 2 + 1 = 3 (Closer than 4)\n            *   Dist(P_down, A3) = |7 - 7| + |8 - 5| = 0 + 3 = 3 (Closer than 4)\n        *   Move RIGHT to P_right=(8, 9):\n            *   Dist(P_right, A1) = |8 - 9| + |9 - 7| = 1 + 2 = 3 (Closer than 4)\n            *   Dist(P_right, A3) = |8 - 7| + |9 - 5| = 1 + 4 = 5 (Further than 4)\n    *   Both DOWN and RIGHT moves bring the snake closer to at least one nearest apple (A1).\n    *   However, DOWN brings the snake closer to *both* nearest apples (A1 and A3), reducing the distance to 3 for both.\n    *   RIGHT brings the snake closer to A1 (distance 3) but further from A3 (distance 5).\n    *   Therefore, DOWN is the strategically better move as it progresses towards both closest targets.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Worst moves: UP (out of bounds), LEFT (collides with self).\n    *   Best move: DOWN (safe and moves closer to the two nearest apples).\n</think>\n<best_answer>DOWN</best_answer>\n<worst_answer>UP, LEFT</worst_answer>",

DOWN moves closer to both nearest apples. RIGHT moves closer to one but further from the other. LEFT is risky and moves further away. Therefore, DOWN is the best strategic move among the safe options.\n6.  **Final Decision:**\n    *   Best move: DOWN (safe, moves closer to both nearest apples).\n    *   Worst move: UP (collides with own body).\n</think>\n<best_answer>DOWN</best_answer>\n<worst_answer>UP</worst_answer>",

DOWN moves closer to both nearest apples. RIGHT moves closer to one but further from the other. LEFT is risky and moves further away. Therefore, DOWN is the best strategic move among the safe options.\n6.  **Final Decision:**\n    *   Best move: DOWN (safe, moves closer to both nearest apples).\n    *   Worst move: UP (collides with own body).\n</think>\n<best_answer>DOWN</best_answer>\n<worst_answer>UP</worst_answer>",

However, strictly by the rules provided (collision with *body*), it might be safe *initially*. But predicting the enemy moving DOWN makes LEFT dangerous.

Assuming no body segments.\n    *   Apples are at: [(6, 8), (9, 7), (6, 2), (5, 6), (3, 9)].\n    *   Board is 10x10 (0,0 to 9,9).\n    *   Last move was LEFT (not relevant for next move calculation, but noted).\n\n2.  **Determine Possible Moves:** From (4, 7), the possible moves are:\n    *   UP: (4, 8)\n    *   DOWN: (4, 6)\n    *   LEFT: (3, 7)\n    *   RIGHT: (5, 7)\n\n3.  **Identify Worst Moves (Check Rule 2):**\n    *   **Out of Bounds:**\n        *   UP (4, 8): Within bounds (0<=4<=9, 0<=8<=9). OK.\n        *   DOWN (4, 6): Within bounds (0<=4<=9, 0<=6<=9). OK.\n        *   LEFT (3, 7): Within bounds (0<=3<=9, 0<=7<=9). OK.\n        *   RIGHT (5, 7): Within bounds (0<=5<=9, 0<=7<=9). OK.\n        *   No boundary violations.\n    *   **Own Body Collision:** My snake has no body segments [], so no self-collision is possible. OK.\n    *   **Enemy Snake Collision:** The enemy snake's head is at (1, 6). Assuming the rule \"into a space occupied by another snake's body\" includes the head position:\n        *   UP (4, 8): Not (1, 6). OK.\n        *   DOWN (4, 6): Not (1, 6). OK.\n        *   LEFT (3, 7): Not (1, 6). OK.\n        *   RIGHT (5, 7): Not (1, 6). OK.\n        *   No collision with the current enemy position.\n    *   **Predict Enemy Move (Optional but good practice):** Enemy at (1, 6) could move to (1, 7), (1, 5), (0, 6), (2, 6). None of these conflict with my potential next moves (4, 8), (4, 6), (3, 7), (5, 7).\n    *   **Conclusion on Worst Moves:** None of the possible moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are worst moves.\n\n4.  **Identify Best Move (Check Rule 3):**\n    *   **Calculate Distances to Apples:** From head (4, 7):\n        *   Apple (6, 8): |4 - 6| + |7 - 8| = 2 + 1 = 3\n        *   Apple (9, 7): |4 - 9| + |7 - 7| = 5 + 0 = 5\n        *   Apple (6, 2): |4 - 6| + |7 - 2| = 2 + 5 = 7\n        *   Apple (5, 6): |4 - 5| + |7 - 6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n        *   Apple (3, 9): |4 - 3| + |7 - 9| = 1 + 2 = 3\n    *   **Find Nearest Apple:** The nearest apple is (5, 6) with a Manhattan distance of 2.\n    *   **Evaluate Moves Towards Nearest Apple (5, 6):**\n        *   UP to (4, 8): New distance to (5, 6) = |4 - 5| + |8 - 6| = 1 + 2 = 3. (Increases distance).\n        *   DOWN to (4, 6): New distance to (5, 6) = |4 - 5| + |6 - 6| = 1 + 0 = 1. (Decreases distance).\n        *   LEFT to (3, 7): New distance to (5, 6) = |3 - 5| + |7 - 6| = 2 + 1 = 3. (Increases distance).\n        *   RIGHT to (5, 7): New distance to (5, 6) = |5 - 5| + |7 - 6| = 0 + 1 = 1. (Decreases distance).\n    *   **Select Best Move:** Both DOWN and RIGHT reduce the distance to the nearest apple (5, 6) maximally (from 2 to 1). Both are safe moves. Following Rule 3, either DOWN or RIGHT is a valid best move. Let's choose one, for example, RIGHT, as it moves towards coordinate 5 which is the x-coordinate of the target apple. It also gets closer to the apple at (6, 8).\n\n5.  **Final Answer Formulation:**\n    *   Best move: RIGHT (or DOWN). Choose RIGHT.\n    *   Worst moves: None.\n</think>\n<best_answer>RIGHT</best_answer>\n<worst_answer>None</worst_answer>",

Therefore, my move LEFT to (4, 6) is likely safe from a head-on collision.\n    *   The only identified worst move is UP due to self-collision.\n\n4.  **Identify best move among safe moves {DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT}:**\n    *   The goal is to get closer to the nearest apple.\n    *   Calculate Manhattan distances from the head (5, 6) to each apple:\n        *   Apple (6, 8): |5 - 6| + |6 - 8| = 1 + 2 = 3\n        *   Apple (9, 7): |5 - 9| + |6 - 7| = 4 + 1 = 5\n        *   Apple (6, 2): |5 - 6| + |6 - 2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n        *   Apple (3, 9): |5 - 3| + |6 - 9| = 2 + 3 = 5\n        *   Apple (5, 9): |5 - 5| + |6 - 9| = 0 + 3 = 3\n    *   The nearest apples are (6, 8) and (5, 9), both at distance 3.\n    *   Evaluate safe moves by calculating the distance to the nearest apples from the resulting positions:\n        *   Move DOWN to (5, 5):\n            *   Dist to (6, 8): |5 - 6| + |5 - 8| = 1 + 3 = 4 (further)\n            *   Dist to (5, 9): |5 - 5| + |5 - 9| = 0 + 4 = 4 (further)\n        *   Move LEFT to (4, 6):\n            *   Dist to (6, 8): |4 - 6| + |6 - 8| = 2 + 2 = 4 (further)\n            *   Dist to (5, 9): |4 - 5| + |6 - 9| = 1 + 3 = 4 (further)\n        *   Move RIGHT to (6, 6):\n            *   Dist to (6, 8): |6 - 6| + |6 - 8| = 0 + 2 = 2 (closer)\n            *   Dist to (5, 9): |6 - 5| + |6 - 9| = 1 + 3 = 4 (further)\n    *   Moving RIGHT is the only safe move that decreases the distance to one of the nearest apples ((6, 8)).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The best move is RIGHT because it is safe and moves closer to the nearest apple at (6, 8). The worst move is UP because it causes a collision with the snake's own body.\n</think><best_answer>RIGHT</best_answer><worst_answer>UP</worst_answer>",

Assuming no body segments.\n    *   Apples are at: [(6, 8), (9, 7), (6, 2), (5, 6), (3, 9)].\n    *   Board is 10x10 (0,0 to 9,9).\n    *   Last move was LEFT (not relevant for next move calculation, but noted).\n\n2.  **Determine Possible Moves:** From (4, 7), the possible moves are:\n    *   UP: (4, 8)\n    *   DOWN: (4, 6)\n    *   LEFT: (3, 7)\n    *   RIGHT: (5, 7)\n\n3.  **Identify Worst Moves (Check Rule 2):**\n    *   **Out of Bounds:**\n        *   UP (4, 8): Within bounds (0<=4<=9, 0<=8<=9). OK.\n        *   DOWN (4, 6): Within bounds (0<=4<=9, 0<=6<=9). OK.\n        *   LEFT (3, 7): Within bounds (0<=3<=9, 0<=7<=9). OK.\n        *   RIGHT (5, 7): Within bounds (0<=5<=9, 0<=7<=9). OK.\n        *   No boundary violations.\n    *   **Own Body Collision:** My snake has no body segments [], so no self-collision is possible. OK.\n    *   **Enemy Snake Collision:** The enemy snake's head is at (1, 6). Assuming the rule \"into a space occupied by another snake's body\" includes the head position:\n        *   UP (4, 8): Not (1, 6). OK.\n        *   DOWN (4, 6): Not (1, 6). OK.\n        *   LEFT (3, 7): Not (1, 6). OK.\n        *   RIGHT (5, 7): Not (1, 6). OK.\n        *   No collision with the current enemy position.\n    *   **Predict Enemy Move (Optional but good practice):** Enemy at (1, 6) could move to (1, 7), (1, 5), (0, 6), (2, 6). None of these conflict with my potential next moves (4, 8), (4, 6), (3, 7), (5, 7).\n    *   **Conclusion on Worst Moves:** None of the possible moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are worst moves.\n\n4.  **Identify Best Move (Check Rule 3):**\n    *   **Calculate Distances to Apples:** From head (4, 7):\n        *   Apple (6, 8): |4 - 6| + |7 - 8| = 2 + 1 = 3\n        *   Apple (9, 7): |4 - 9| + |7 - 7| = 5 + 0 = 5\n        *   Apple (6, 2): |4 - 6| + |7 - 2| = 2 + 5 = 7\n        *   Apple (5, 6): |4 - 5| + |7 - 6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n        *   Apple (3, 9): |4 - 3| + |7 - 9| = 1 + 2 = 3\n    *   **Find Nearest Apple:** The nearest apple is (5, 6) with a Manhattan distance of 2.\n    *   **Evaluate Moves Towards Nearest Apple (5, 6):**\n        *   UP to (4, 8): New distance to (5, 6) = |4 - 5| + |8 - 6| = 1 + 2 = 3. (Increases distance).\n        *   DOWN to (4, 6): New distance to (5, 6) = |4 - 5| + |6 - 6| = 1 + 0 = 1. (Decreases distance).\n        *   LEFT to (3, 7): New distance to (5, 6) = |3 - 5| + |7 - 6| = 2 + 1 = 3. (Increases distance).\n        *   RIGHT to (5, 7): New distance to (5, 6) = |5 - 5| + |7 - 6| = 0 + 1 = 1. (Decreases distance).\n    *   **Select Best Move:** Both DOWN and RIGHT reduce the distance to the nearest apple (5, 6) maximally (from 2 to 1). Both are safe moves. Following Rule 3, either DOWN or RIGHT is a valid best move. Let's choose one, for example, RIGHT, as it moves towards coordinate 5 which is the x-coordinate of the target apple. It also gets closer to the apple at (6, 8).\n\n5.  **Final Answer Formulation:**\n    *   Best move: RIGHT (or DOWN). Choose RIGHT.\n    *   Worst moves: None.\n</think>\n<best_answer>RIGHT</best_answer>\n<worst_answer>None</worst_answer>",

Therefore, my move LEFT to (4, 6) is likely safe from a head-on collision.\n    *   The only identified worst move is UP due to self-collision.\n\n4.  **Identify best move among safe moves {DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT}:**\n    *   The goal is to get closer to the nearest apple.\n    *   Calculate Manhattan distances from the head (5, 6) to each apple:\n        *   Apple (6, 8): |5 - 6| + |6 - 8| = 1 + 2 = 3\n        *   Apple (9, 7): |5 - 9| + |6 - 7| = 4 + 1 = 5\n        *   Apple (6, 2): |5 - 6| + |6 - 2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n        *   Apple (3, 9): |5 - 3| + |6 - 9| = 2 + 3 = 5\n        *   Apple (5, 9): |5 - 5| + |6 - 9| = 0 + 3 = 3\n    *   The nearest apples are (6, 8) and (5, 9), both at distance 3.\n    *   Evaluate safe moves by calculating the distance to the nearest apples from the resulting positions:\n        *   Move DOWN to (5, 5):\n            *   Dist to (6, 8): |5 - 6| + |5 - 8| = 1 + 3 = 4 (further)\n            *   Dist to (5, 9): |5 - 5| + |5 - 9| = 0 + 4 = 4 (further)\n        *   Move LEFT to (4, 6):\n            *   Dist to (6, 8): |4 - 6| + |6 - 8| = 2 + 2 = 4 (further)\n            *   Dist to (5, 9): |4 - 5| + |6 - 9| = 1 + 3 = 4 (further)\n        *   Move RIGHT to (6, 6):\n            *   Dist to (6, 8): |6 - 6| + |6 - 8| = 0 + 2 = 2 (closer)\n            *   Dist to (5, 9): |6 - 5| + |6 - 9| = 1 + 3 = 4 (further)\n    *   Moving RIGHT is the only safe move that decreases the distance to one of the nearest apples ((6, 8)).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The best move is RIGHT because it is safe and moves closer to the nearest apple at (6, 8). The worst move is UP because it causes a collision with the snake's own body.\n</think><best_answer>RIGHT</best_answer><worst_answer>UP</worst_answer>",

Gets closer (3 -> 2).\n        *   Move LEFT to (8, 6): New distance to (7, 5) = |8 - 7| + |6 - 5| = 1 + 1 = 2. Gets closer (3 -> 2).\n    *   Both DOWN and LEFT are safe and move closer to the nearest apple.\n\n5.  **Consider Enemy Prediction (Tie-breaker/Risk Assessment):**\n    *   Enemy head is at (7, 6). Possible safe moves for the enemy: UP (7, 7 - collision with my body, risky for enemy), DOWN (7, 5 - gets apple), RIGHT (8, 6 - safe). Enemy likely moves DOWN to (7, 5) to get the apple, or possibly RIGHT to (8, 6).\n    *   If I move LEFT to (8, 6) and the enemy moves RIGHT to (8, 6), there is a potential head-on collision. Depending on game rules, this could be fatal.\n    *   If I move DOWN to (9, 5), I avoid the potential collision spot (8, 6) and also avoid the apple spot (7, 5) where the enemy might go. This seems slightly safer.\n\n6.  **Final Decision:** Both DOWN and LEFT are safe and equally good in terms of distance to the nearest apple. DOWN avoids a potential head-on collision risk at (8,6) if the enemy moves RIGHT. Therefore, DOWN is the preferred best move.\n</think>\n<best_answer>DOWN</best_answer>\n<worst_answer>UP, RIGHT</worst_answer>",

Following Rule 3, either DOWN or RIGHT is a valid best move. Let's choose one, for example, RIGHT, as it moves towards coordinate 5 which is the x-coordinate of the target apple. It also gets closer to the apple at (6, 8).\n\n5.  **Final Answer Formulation:**\n    *   Best move: RIGHT (or DOWN).

Does not collide with enemy head's current position (7, 3). However, need to consider enemy's next move later.\n\n4.  **List Worst Moves:** Based on the above checks, the worst moves are UP (self-collision) and RIGHT (out of bounds).\n\n5.  **Identify Safe Moves:** The moves not identified as worst moves are:\n    *   DOWN: (9, 2)\n    *   LEFT: (8, 3)\n\n6.  **Find the Nearest Apple:** Calculate Manhattan distances from the current head (9, 3) to each apple:\n    *   Apple (6, 2): |9 - 6| + |3 - 2| = 3 + 1 = 4\n    *   Apple (0, 5): |9 - 0| + |3 - 5| = 9 + 2 = 11\n    *   Apple (3, 3): |9 - 3| + |3 - 3| = 6 + 0 = 6\n    *   Apple (6, 0): |9 - 6| + |3 - 0| = 3 + 3 = 6\n    *   Apple (0, 8): |9 - 0| + |3 - 8| = 9 + 5 = 14\n    *   The nearest apple is at (6, 2) with a distance of 4.\n\n7.  **Evaluate Safe Moves Towards Nearest Apple (6, 2):**\n    *   Current distance to (6, 2) is 4.\n    *   Move DOWN to (9, 2): New distance to (6, 2) = |9 - 6| + |2 - 2| = 3 + 0 = 3. This moves closer (reduction of 1).\n    *   Move LEFT to (8, 3): New distance to (6, 2) = |8 - 6| + |3 - 2| = 2 + 1 = 3. This moves closer (reduction of 1).\n    *   Both DOWN and LEFT are equally good in terms of getting closer to the nearest apple.\n\n8.  **Consider Enemy Snake's Potential Moves:**\n    *   Enemy head is at (7, 3), body is [(7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6)].\n    *   Possible enemy moves:\n        *   UP (7, 4): Collides with own body (Worst for enemy).\n        *   DOWN (7, 2): Safe for enemy.\n        *   LEFT (6, 3): Safe for enemy.\n        *   RIGHT (8, 3): Safe for enemy.\n    *   If I choose LEFT (moving to 8, 3) and the enemy chooses RIGHT (moving to 8, 3), there will be a head-on collision. This is a potential risk associated with moving LEFT.\n    *   If I choose DOWN (moving to 9, 2), it avoids this potential head-on collision, regardless of the enemy's safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).\n\n9.  **Determine the Best Move:**\n    *   Priority 1: Avoid death. Both DOWN and LEFT are safe from immediate death based on current board state.\n    *   Priority 2: Move towards the nearest apple. Both DOWN and LEFT reduce the distance to the nearest apple by 1.\n    *   Priority 3: Consider secondary risks (like enemy moves). Moving LEFT carries a risk of head-on collision with the enemy if it moves RIGHT. Moving DOWN does not have this immediate risk.\n    *   Therefore, DOWN is the safer option while still achieving the goal of moving towards the nearest apple.\n\n10. **Final Decision:**\n    *   Best Move: DOWN.\n    *   Worst Moves: UP, RIGHT.\n</think><best_answer>DOWN</best_answer><worst_answer>UP, RIGHT</worst_answer>",

However, need to consider enemy's next move later.\n\n4.  **List Worst Moves:** Based on the above checks, the worst moves are UP (self-collision) and RIGHT (out of bounds).\n\n5.  **Identify Safe Moves:** The moves not identified as worst moves are:\n    *   DOWN: (9, 2)\n    *   LEFT: (8, 3)\n\n6.  **Find the Nearest Apple:** Calculate Manhattan distances from the current head (9, 3) to each apple:\n    *   Apple (6, 2): |9 - 6| + |3 - 2| = 3 + 1 = 4\n    *   Apple (0, 5): |9 - 0| + |3 - 5| = 9 + 2 = 11\n    *   Apple (3, 3): |9 - 3| + |3 - 3| = 6 + 0 = 6\n    *   Apple (6, 0): |9 - 6| + |3 - 0| = 3 + 3 = 6\n    *   Apple (0, 8): |9 - 0| + |3 - 8| = 9 + 5 = 14\n    *   The nearest apple is at (6, 2) with a distance of 4.\n\n7.  **Evaluate Safe Moves Towards Nearest Apple (6, 2):**\n    *   Current distance to (6, 2) is 4.\n    *   Move DOWN to (9, 2): New distance to (6, 2) = |9 - 6| + |2 - 2| = 3 + 0 = 3. This moves closer (reduction of 1).\n    *   Move LEFT to (8, 3): New distance to (6, 2) = |8 - 6| + |3 - 2| = 2 + 1 = 3. This moves closer (reduction of 1).\n    *   Both DOWN and LEFT are equally good in terms of getting closer to the nearest apple.\n\n8.  **Consider Enemy Snake's Potential Moves:**\n    *   Enemy head is at (7, 3), body is [(7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6)].\n    *   Possible enemy moves:\n        *   UP (7, 4): Collides with own body (Worst for enemy).\n        *   DOWN (7, 2): Safe for enemy.\n        *   LEFT (6, 3): Safe for enemy.\n        *   RIGHT (8, 3): Safe for enemy.\n    *   If I choose LEFT (moving to 8, 3) and the enemy chooses RIGHT (moving to 8, 3), there will be a head-on collision. This is a potential risk associated with moving LEFT.\n    *   If I choose DOWN (moving to 9, 2), it avoids this potential head-on collision, regardless of the enemy's safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).\n\n9.  **Determine the Best Move:**\n    *   Priority 1: Avoid death. Both DOWN and LEFT are safe from immediate death based on current board state.\n    *   Priority 2: Move towards the nearest apple. Both DOWN and LEFT reduce the distance to the nearest apple by 1.\n    *   Priority 3: Consider secondary risks (like enemy moves). Moving LEFT carries a risk of head-on collision with the enemy if it moves RIGHT. Moving DOWN does not have this immediate risk.\n    *   Therefore, DOWN is the safer option while still achieving the goal of moving towards the nearest apple.\n\n10. **Final Decision:**\n    *   Best Move: DOWN.\n    *   Worst Moves: UP, RIGHT.\n</think><best_answer>DOWN</best_answer><worst_answer>UP, RIGHT</worst_answer>",

Assuming no body segments.\n    *   Apples are at: [(6, 8), (9, 7), (6, 2), (5, 6), (3, 9)].\n    *   Board is 10x10 (0,0 to 9,9).\n    *   Last move was LEFT (not relevant for next move calculation, but noted).\n\n2.  **Determine Possible Moves:** From (4, 7), the possible moves are:\n    *   UP: (4, 8)\n    *   DOWN: (4, 6)\n    *   LEFT: (3, 7)\n    *   RIGHT: (5, 7)\n\n3.  **Identify Worst Moves (Check Rule 2):**\n    *   **Out of Bounds:**\n        *   UP (4, 8): Within bounds (0<=4<=9, 0<=8<=9). OK.\n        *   DOWN (4, 6): Within bounds (0<=4<=9, 0<=6<=9). OK.\n        *   LEFT (3, 7): Within bounds (0<=3<=9, 0<=7<=9). OK.\n        *   RIGHT (5, 7): Within bounds (0<=5<=9, 0<=7<=9). OK.\n        *   No boundary violations.\n    *   **Own Body Collision:** My snake has no body segments [], so no self-collision is possible. OK.\n    *   **Enemy Snake Collision:** The enemy snake's head is at (1, 6). Assuming the rule \"into a space occupied by another snake's body\" includes the head position:\n        *   UP (4, 8): Not (1, 6). OK.\n        *   DOWN (4, 6): Not (1, 6). OK.\n        *   LEFT (3, 7): Not (1, 6). OK.\n        *   RIGHT (5, 7): Not (1, 6). OK.\n        *   No collision with the current enemy position.\n    *   **Predict Enemy Move (Optional but good practice):** Enemy at (1, 6) could move to (1, 7), (1, 5), (0, 6), (2, 6). None of these conflict with my potential next moves (4, 8), (4, 6), (3, 7), (5, 7).\n    *   **Conclusion on Worst Moves:** None of the possible moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are worst moves.\n\n4.  **Identify Best Move (Check Rule 3):**\n    *   **Calculate Distances to Apples:** From head (4, 7):\n        *   Apple (6, 8): |4 - 6| + |7 - 8| = 2 + 1 = 3\n        *   Apple (9, 7): |4 - 9| + |7 - 7| = 5 + 0 = 5\n        *   Apple (6, 2): |4 - 6| + |7 - 2| = 2 + 5 = 7\n        *   Apple (5, 6): |4 - 5| + |7 - 6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n        *   Apple (3, 9): |4 - 3| + |7 - 9| = 1 + 2 = 3\n    *   **Find Nearest Apple:** The nearest apple is (5, 6) with a Manhattan distance of 2.\n    *   **Evaluate Moves Towards Nearest Apple (5, 6):**\n        *   UP to (4, 8): New distance to (5, 6) = |4 - 5| + |8 - 6| = 1 + 2 = 3. (Increases distance).\n        *   DOWN to (4, 6): New distance to (5, 6) = |4 - 5| + |6 - 6| = 1 + 0 = 1. (Decreases distance).\n        *   LEFT to (3, 7): New distance to (5, 6) = |3 - 5| + |7 - 6| = 2 + 1 = 3. (Increases distance).\n        *   RIGHT to (5, 7): New distance to (5, 6) = |5 - 5| + |7 - 6| = 0 + 1 = 1. (Decreases distance).\n    *   **Select Best Move:** Both DOWN and RIGHT reduce the distance to the nearest apple (5, 6) maximally (from 2 to 1). Both are safe moves. Following Rule 3, either DOWN or RIGHT is a valid best move. Let's choose one, for example, RIGHT, as it moves towards coordinate 5 which is the x-coordinate of the target apple. It also gets closer to the apple at (6, 8).\n\n5.  **Final Answer Formulation:**\n    *   Best move: RIGHT (or DOWN). Choose RIGHT.\n    *   Worst moves: None.\n</think>\n<best_answer>RIGHT</best_answer>\n<worst_answer>None</worst_answer>",

Therefore, my move LEFT to (4, 6) is likely safe from a head-on collision.\n    *   The only identified worst move is UP due to self-collision.\n\n4.  **Identify best move among safe moves {DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT}:**\n    *   The goal is to get closer to the nearest apple.\n    *   Calculate Manhattan distances from the head (5, 6) to each apple:\n        *   Apple (6, 8): |5 - 6| + |6 - 8| = 1 + 2 = 3\n        *   Apple (9, 7): |5 - 9| + |6 - 7| = 4 + 1 = 5\n        *   Apple (6, 2): |5 - 6| + |6 - 2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n        *   Apple (3, 9): |5 - 3| + |6 - 9| = 2 + 3 = 5\n        *   Apple (5, 9): |5 - 5| + |6 - 9| = 0 + 3 = 3\n    *   The nearest apples are (6, 8) and (5, 9), both at distance 3.\n    *   Evaluate safe moves by calculating the distance to the nearest apples from the resulting positions:\n        *   Move DOWN to (5, 5):\n            *   Dist to (6, 8): |5 - 6| + |5 - 8| = 1 + 3 = 4 (further)\n            *   Dist to (5, 9): |5 - 5| + |5 - 9| = 0 + 4 = 4 (further)\n        *   Move LEFT to (4, 6):\n            *   Dist to (6, 8): |4 - 6| + |6 - 8| = 2 + 2 = 4 (further)\n            *   Dist to (5, 9): |4 - 5| + |6 - 9| = 1 + 3 = 4 (further)\n        *   Move RIGHT to (6, 6):\n            *   Dist to (6, 8): |6 - 6| + |6 - 8| = 0 + 2 = 2 (closer)\n            *   Dist to (5, 9): |6 - 5| + |6 - 9| = 1 + 3 = 4 (further)\n    *   Moving RIGHT is the only safe move that decreases the distance to one of the nearest apples ((6, 8)).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The best move is RIGHT because it is safe and moves closer to the nearest apple at (6, 8). The worst move is UP because it causes a collision with the snake's own body.\n</think><best_answer>RIGHT</best_answer><worst_answer>UP</worst_answer>",

Gets closer (3 -> 2).\n    *   Both DOWN and LEFT are safe and move closer to the nearest apple.\n\n5.  **Consider Enemy Prediction (Tie-breaker/Risk Assessment):**\n    *   Enemy head is at (7, 6). Possible safe moves for the enemy: UP (7, 7 - collision with my body, risky for enemy), DOWN (7, 5 - gets apple), RIGHT (8, 6 - safe). Enemy likely moves DOWN to (7, 5) to get the apple, or possibly RIGHT to (8, 6).\n    *   If I move LEFT to (8, 6) and the enemy moves RIGHT to (8, 6), there is a potential head-on collision. Depending on game rules, this could be fatal.\n    *   If I move DOWN to (9, 5), I avoid the potential collision spot (8, 6) and also avoid the apple spot (7, 5) where the enemy might go. This seems slightly safer.\n\n6.  **Final Decision:** Both DOWN and LEFT are safe and equally good in terms of distance to the nearest apple. DOWN avoids a potential head-on collision risk at (8,6) if the enemy moves RIGHT. Therefore, DOWN is the preferred best move.\n</think>\n<best_answer>DOWN</best_answer>\n<worst_answer>UP, RIGHT</worst_answer>",

This is a potential risk associated with moving LEFT.\n    *   If I choose DOWN (moving to 9, 2), it avoids this potential head-on collision, regardless of the enemy's safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).\n\n9.  **Determine the Best Move:**\n    *   Priority 1: Avoid death. Both DOWN and LEFT are safe from immediate death based on current board state.\n    *   Priority 2: Move towards the nearest apple.

Moving LEFT carries a risk of head-on collision with the enemy if it moves RIGHT. Moving DOWN does not have this immediate risk.\n    *   Therefore, DOWN is the safer option while still achieving the goal of moving towards the nearest apple.\n\n10. **Final Decision:**\n    *   Best Move: DOWN.\n    *   Worst Moves: UP, RIGHT.\n</think><best_answer>DOWN</best_answer><worst_answer>UP, RIGHT</worst_answer>",

Therefore, LEFT is the slightly better strategic move.\n\n6.  **Final Decision:**\n    *   Worst Moves: UP (self-collision), RIGHT (out of bounds).\n    *   Best Move: LEFT (safe, moves towards nearest apple and secondary nearest apples).\n</think>\n<best_answer>LEFT</best_answer>\n<worst_answer>UP, RIGHT</worst_answer>",

This is a potential risk associated with moving LEFT.\n    *   If I choose DOWN (moving to 9, 2), it avoids this potential head-on collision, regardless of the enemy's safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).\n\n9.  **Determine the Best Move:**\n    *   Priority 1: Avoid death. Both DOWN and LEFT are safe from immediate death based on current board state.\n    *   Priority 2: Move towards the nearest apple.

Moving LEFT carries a risk of head-on collision with the enemy if it moves RIGHT. Moving DOWN does not have this immediate risk.\n    *   Therefore, DOWN is the safer option while still achieving the goal of moving towards the nearest apple.\n\n10. **Final Decision:**\n    *   Best Move: DOWN.\n    *   Worst Moves: UP, RIGHT.\n</think><best_answer>DOWN</best_answer><worst_answer>UP, RIGHT</worst_answer>",

OK.\n        *   No boundary violations.\n    *   **Own Body Collision:** My snake has no body segments [], so no self-collision is possible. OK.\n    *   **Enemy Snake Collision:** The enemy snake's head is at (1, 6). Assuming the rule \"into a space occupied by another snake's body\" includes the head position:\n        *   UP (4, 8): Not (1, 6). OK.\n        *   DOWN (4, 6): Not (1, 6).

None of these conflict with my potential next moves (4, 8), (4, 6), (3, 7), (5, 7).\n    *   **Conclusion on Worst Moves:** None of the possible moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are worst moves.\n\n4.  **Identify Best Move (Check Rule 3):**\n    *   **Calculate Distances to Apples:** From head (4, 7):\n        *   Apple (6, 8): |4 - 6| + |7 - 8| = 2 + 1 = 3\n        *   Apple (9, 7): |4 - 9| + |7 - 7| = 5 + 0 = 5\n        *   Apple (6, 2): |4 - 6| + |7 - 2| = 2 + 5 = 7\n        *   Apple (5, 6): |4 - 5| + |7 - 6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n        *   Apple (3, 9): |4 - 3| + |7 - 9| = 1 + 2 = 3\n    *   **Find Nearest Apple:** The nearest apple is (5, 6) with a Manhattan distance of 2.\n    *   **Evaluate Moves Towards Nearest Apple (5, 6):**\n        *   UP to (4, 8): New distance to (5, 6) = |4 - 5| + |8 - 6| = 1 + 2 = 3.

Following Rule 3, either DOWN or RIGHT is a valid best move. Let's choose one, for example, RIGHT, as it moves towards coordinate 5 which is the x-coordinate of the target apple. It also gets closer to the apple at (6, 8).\n\n5.  **Final Answer Formulation:**\n    *   Best move: RIGHT (or DOWN).

This position *is* the nearest apple. Distance becomes 0.\n        *   **RIGHT:** Moves to (7, 9). The distance to the nearest apple (5, 9) becomes |7 - 5| + |9 - 9| = 2. This moves away from the nearest apple but closer to apples (9,7) and (7,5).\n\n7.  **Consider Enemy Prediction (Refined Safety Check):**\n    *   Enemy head is at (4, 9), body at (3, 9).\n    *   Possible enemy moves from (4, 9): UP (out of bounds), DOWN (4, 8 - safe), LEFT (3, 9 - own body collision), RIGHT (5, 9 - safe).\n    *   The enemy is likely to move DOWN to (4, 8) or RIGHT to (5, 9).\n    *   If I move LEFT to (5, 9) and the enemy moves RIGHT to (5, 9), there will be a head-on collision, which means death.\n    *   Moving LEFT directly targets the nearest apple but carries a significant risk of collision based on a likely enemy move.\n    *   Moving RIGHT to (7, 9) avoids this potential collision. It's a guaranteed safe move in the immediate next step.\n\n8.  **Final Decision:**\n    *   Priority 1 is survival. Moving LEFT risks death due to potential enemy collision. Moving RIGHT is safe.\n    *   Therefore, RIGHT is the better move, prioritizing survival over immediately getting the closest apple.\n    *   Worst Moves: UP (out of bounds), DOWN (own body collision).\n\n</think><best_answer>RIGHT</best_answer><worst_answer>UP, DOWN</worst_answer>",

Possible enemy moves: UP (6,9), DOWN (6,7), RIGHT (7,8 - blocked by my body), LEFT (5,8 - blocked by its own body). If the enemy moves DOWN, it will go to (6, 7). This is a potential head-on collision. According to the rules, avoid moves into spaces occupied by *another snake's body*. It doesn't explicitly forbid head-on collisions, but they are generally fatal in Snake games. Given the risk and rule interpretation ambiguity, let's consider LEFT riskier than DOWN or RIGHT. However, strictly by the rules provided (collision with *body*), it might be safe *initially*. But predicting the enemy moving DOWN makes LEFT dangerous. Let's stick to the explicit rules: rule 2 only mentions collision with *body*.

Possible safe moves for the enemy are LEFT (to 5, 0) and RIGHT (to 7, 0). (UP hits its body, DOWN is out of bounds).\n    *   If I move LEFT to (7, 0) and the enemy moves RIGHT to (7, 0), there could be a head-on collision or simultaneous move into the same square, which should be avoided as per the instruction \"avoid colliding with it\".\n    *   Moving RIGHT to (9, 0) avoids any potential conflict with the enemy's next move, as the enemy cannot reach (9, 0) in one step.\n    *   Since the primary goal is survival, and avoiding collision with the enemy is part of that, choosing the move that guarantees no enemy collision this turn is safer, even if it doesn't immediately reduce the distance to the apple.\n\n10. **Final Decision:**\n    *   Worst Moves: UP, DOWN.\n    *   Best Move: RIGHT (prioritizes safety from potential enemy collision over immediate proximity to the apple). LEFT is a valid alternative if head-on collisions aren't a concern or enemy prediction is deemed less critical than apple proximity, but RIGHT is safer according to the instructions.\n</think>\n<best_answer>RIGHT</best_answer>\n<worst_answer>UP, DOWN</worst_answer>",
